- [ ] National standard carbon emission calculation related information
- [ ] Search function for table lookup (to consider how to find the most correct one when there are multiple data for the same material)
- [ ] Artificial intelligence for proper estimation of carbon emission factors of new materials (e.g. rammed earth)
- [ ] Consider introducing gpt port to do semantic understanding
- [ ] Make the above into - a UI
